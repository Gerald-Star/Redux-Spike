Problem Explanation
The goal of this challenge is to return a new copy of state in reducer function because of state immutability in Redux.

NOTE 
Redux does not actively enforce state immutability in its store or reducers, that responsibility falls on the programmer. Fortunately, JavaScript (especially ES6) provides several useful tools you can use to enforce the immutability of your state, whether it is a string, number, array, or object


HINT 1
const means it cannot be reassigned or changed or redclared.

Since objects are mutable, you can add it by index (array[3]=3)
by property (object.name="sampl)

HINT 2
You use .push() and .pop() and .slice() methods directly modify an array

HINT 3
.concat() does not modify array but just returns a new array

HINT 4
.slice() does not modify array but just returns a new array

HINT 5
spread operator[...array] does not modify array but just returns a new array
